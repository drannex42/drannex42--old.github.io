# Macleod Sawyer

**Welcome! This is my own personal little micro-blog.** 

**Short About:** Lover of Jazz, Turtles/Tortoises, and reading (especially Science Fiction and Autobiographies).  High School Dropout. 20.

I occasionally will post writings, thoughts, and other random things here. No promises on the content as my brain tends to go a million miles per hour in an infinite amount of categories.  These will link internally, or to other placed. my break at any time.

I am the founder and CEO of Sawyer Innovations [Si], and our new product line OpenLeaf. 

**Experience**: Founded two acquired bootstrapped companies, was inducted into the Library of Congress, ran for office, elected five people to office, raised over $50,000 for grassroots causes, had a social media following of close to a million before retiring (at 19).
