Today I am announcing with a heavy heart the ending of the GoodPlatform.org ecosystem and platform.

We are currently reviewing other options for the platform, and are in hopes to return to the project within the next three years in a similar way. 

Some of our quick user statitstics

1. We grew to over 35,000 users within three months. 
2. Helped donate to seven different charities.
3. Over 40 petitions were created on the platform with over 21 different updates. 

We are not saying goodbye forever, but for now we are having to part ways. 

Thank you everyone.
